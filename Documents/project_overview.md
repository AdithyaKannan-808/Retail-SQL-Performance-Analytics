#  Project Overview

This project delivers an end-to-end **SQL analytics workflow** for retail sales performance.  
It integrates transactional orders, return records, and salesperson-region mappings into a unified analytical model, enabling monthly performance measurement, target modelling, and ranking.

The project demonstrates how SQL alone can be used to build a complete analytics pipeline—similar to how businesses track sales efficiency, profitability, and target attainment.
